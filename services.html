            <h3>Sunday Morning 10:30 - 11:30 a.m.</h3>
            <li>
                The current weekly Bible Lesson Sermon is read to the congregation by two Readers. The King James Version of the Bible is read by the Second Reader, and "Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures" by Mary Baker Eddy is read by the First Reader. These two books are the pastors of Christian Science churches throughout the world. The same Lesson Sermon is read on Sundays in Christian Science churches in over 70 countries worldwide.
            </li>
            <h3>Sunday School 10:30 - 11:30 a.m.</h3>
            <li>
                Sunday School is held at the same time as church. Students are taught lessons based on the teaching and healing works of Christ Jesus. They also learn how they can rely on God, and how they can prove for themselves that spiritual thinking and living is practical, and brings blessings to all aspects of their lives. For children too young for Sunday School we offer free child care during services.
            </li>
            <h3>Wednesday Evening Testimonial Meetings 7:30 - 8:30 p.m.</h3>
            <h5>Only held on the first Wednesday of the Month.</h5>
            <li>
                After the opening hymn, there are brief readings from the Bible and "Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures" by Mary Baker Eddy. Following these are a few moments of silent prayer and the second hymn. Then testimonies are given by those wishing to share healing experiences that have come about through the study and application of Christian Science in their daily lives. The meeting closes with the singing of the third hymn.

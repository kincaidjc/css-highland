            The first known Science & Health was brought to Hammond Indiana in 1892 by Mrs. Anna Dow Smith.  Over the years others became interested in Christian Science, and in 1907 the first practictioner, Mrs. Lora Norton had established an office here.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            On October 13 1907 ten people met at the home of Mr. D. W. Blackburn on Harrison Avenue, where a Christian Science Society was formed.  Whithin two months the Blackburn home had become too crowded, and they rented the Knights of Pythias Hall for services.  Many Scientists from Chicago attended these early meetings bringing encouragement, and inspiration.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            In January of 1908 a Reading Room was opened in the Hammond Building. The Sunday School was also started in this year, and the first lecture was given by Bliss Knapp in the Masonic Temple.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            In the Spring of 1917, the Church owned by the Presbyterians, which had recently been destroyed by fire leaving only the stone walls, was offered for $4,500. To own property it was necessery to incorporate as a Church.  This was done on May 7th 1917.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            On December 2 1917, First Church of Christ, Scientist, Hammond was formally opened for services. Six years later the entire cost of the $14,376.63 for the lot and reconstruction was paid for, through contributions, and a generous gift of $3,400 from the Trustees under the Will of Mary Baker Eddy. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            Many times in the ensuing years the members contemplated changes to the building due to a growing membership, but the debt to the Trustees needed to be repaid first. The final payment was recorded in 1950. Now the Church was ready to expand.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            In 1954 it was voted that the Building Fund be used for a new Church and the Church Building, and Ground Floor Reading Room Committees were formed. Property was purchased in the form of two adjacent lots on Hohman Avenue in 1955, and 1956.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            A ground floor Reading Room was established on Russel Street in downtown Hammond. An Architect, Mr. Albert Nemoede, was hired to plan a new Church edifice. By January 1967 the Building Fund surpassed $50,000. So work on the blueprints for the new Church was sped up, and the Building Commitee began to meet weekly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            During this time the membership held regular inspirational meetings. Knowing that before the new Church building could be demonstrated, spiritual building would have to be established in the conciousness, and lives of the members.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            In April 1967 Marc T. Neilson was commissioned as the Interior Decorator. In May the Church membership voted to accept the blueprints and to invite three local contractors to bid on the construction.  In June 1967 the lowest bid of $173,723.00 by the Brant Construction Company was accepted.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            A loan of $145,000.00 was obtained from the Mercantile National Bank of Indiana, and construction began in August 1967.  The Cornerstone was laid during a brief ceremony on October 25th, 1967. The Church building was completed, and the first service was held on Sunday, June 30, 1968.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            The old Church Building was sold to the Northern Indiana Art Association for $22,500.00.  The proceeds of the sale were applied to the pricipal of the mortgage. The final payment being processed in March 1983, and  arrangments were made to dedicate the Church just fifteen years after it's completion in June, 1968.
